# 🎨 **Prediction and Optimization of Red Iron Oxide Pigments**

This project is based on the article titled **"Prediction and Optimization of Red Iron Oxide"**. In this study, we synthesize red iron oxide pigments from mill scale through a simple, economical, and environmentally friendly method. The project explores how synthesis parameters influence pigment color using machine learning.

## 📌 Project Overview

The study demonstrates how varying synthesis conditions can optimize the production of red iron oxide pigments. Key process parameters include:
- **Oxidizing agent content**
- **Calcination time and temperature**

🧬 To synthesize red iron oxide pigments:
1. Mill scale is reacted with sulfuric acid to achieve ferrous sulfate (FeSO₄·XH₂O).
2. The ferrous sulfate is oxidized with sodium nitrate at varying amounts.
3. The mixture is calcined at different temperatures and times to produce pigments of different red shades.

The resulting powders were characterized using:
- X-ray Diffraction (XRD)
- Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM)
- Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS)

It was observed that the amount of oxidizing agent, calcination time, and temperature affect particle size and morphology, leading to different shades of red.

## 🤖 Machine Learning Approach

Six supervised machine learning models were employed to predict the color values (L*, a*, b*) based on process parameters:
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)🥇**
- **Random Forest (RF)**
- **Linear Regression (LR)**
- **Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)**
- **Decision Tree (DT)**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**

Using seven-fold cross-validation, the **SVM model** achieved the highest predictive accuracy with a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 87.92%.
